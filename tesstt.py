    # Semgrep Assistant suggested fix for tainted-dill-aws-lambda
    # Use JSON or another safe serialization format instead of dill for handling
    # untrusted input. The below code should be adapted to your specific use case.
    # This fix assumes 'event' contains JSON serialized data and uses json.loads
    # to safely deserialize it without executing arbitrary code.

    # Note: import json if not already imported and ensure cleaned_data is used securely.

    # Assuming event['exploit_code'] would be a dictionary after json.loads.
    # The variable tainted now holds the serialized form of it.
    cleaned_data = json.loads(tainted)

    # Process cleaned_data here securely without using dill for deserialization.
    # Further security measures like input validation, sanitization, or verification
    # may still be needed depending on the use case.

    # Note: The rest of the dill-specific code should be removed or refactored
    # considering the changed approach to handling the untrusted input
    # and all references to the tainted variable should be replaced with
    # secure alternatives.
